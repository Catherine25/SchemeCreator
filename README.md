# SchemeCreator
Software for creating simple schemes

The software used for modeling simple combinational logic schemes.
Scheme consists of a set of logical gates, scheme IN/OUT and a set of wires.
The logical gates library includes: Buffer, NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and XNOR.

Will be implemented wire tracing algorythm, line adding, coloring, removing.

Gate can be added on the specical dots.
Wire can be added from one gate output to another gate input.

Wires can change their colour by depending on their boolean value.
The values apply to all wires from IN to OUT with change of their colour.
