# SchemeCreator
Software for creating simple schemes

The software used for modeling simple combinational logic schemes.

Scheme consists of a set of logical gates, external IN/OUT and a set of wires.
The logical gates library includes: Buffer, NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and XNOR.
User can add wires to connect gates.

Also can be used wire tracing system.

Gate can be added on the specical dots.
Wire can be added from one gate output to another gate input.

Wires and external gates can change their color depending on their boolean value.
Light color means '1' or true, dark means '0' or false.
